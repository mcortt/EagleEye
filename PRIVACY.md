    vpnapi.io: To detect if the IP belongs to a VPN, Proxy, or Tor node.

    ipinfo.io: To determine geographic location (City/Country) for mapping.

3. What is NOT Collected

    No Email Content: We do not read, store, or transmit the body, subject line, or attachments of your emails.

    No Personal Identifiers: We do not collect your email address, name, or contacts.

    No Tracking: EagleEye does not include analytics or usage tracking.

4. Data Retention

    Local Cache: Analysis results are stored locally in your Thunderbird browser storage to improve performance. This cache is automatically deleted after 7 days (for IP data) or 24 hours (for email analysis).

    External: Data sent to third-party APIs is subject to their respective privacy policies.

5. User Control You can disable specific API integrations in the EagleEye Settings menu at any time.
